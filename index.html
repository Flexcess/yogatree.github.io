                <p>
                    Yogatree’s yoga studio is thoughtfully designed to bring out the best in your yoga practice. The brainchild of Mayuri, who
                    discovered yoga while recovering from a life threatening accident, Yogatree has all the elements necessary for a
                    fulfilling yoga experience. Mayuri’s innate desire to help others with the knowledge that changed her own life is
                    evident in the thought and love that has gone into designing every detail in the studio. She believes that everyday
                    practice is key to understanding your body and benefiting from yoga. Every element at Yogatree — from the way the
                    studio looks, smells, and feels — is designed to encourage daily practice. Come, experience this space for yourself
                    and benefit from the fruit of the tree of yoga.

                <p>
                    At Yogatree, our teachers respect yoga for the positive change that it has brought to their lives. Trained in multiple styles
                    of yoga, they are knowledgeable, experienced, and great fun to train with. Their deep sense of empathy, by virtue
                    of their own challenging journeys as yoga practitioners has helped them develop a strong connect with the students
                    to help them grow and get better in their quest for a healthy body and a quiet mind. Each one brings in their unique
                    style of teaching yoga. But what connects them is a deep personal experience of yoga and the missionary zeal to spread
                    the benefits of yoga.

                                    Yoga here for more than one and a half year now and it has been a beautiful journey so far... life transforming.
                                    Mayuri has a wonderful team, everybody having a holistic approach towards the practice. Most importantantly
                                    they taught us how to breathe - When to inhale and when to exhale and how proper breathing is the fuel
                                    of Life. Such constant explanations are given to the practioners while they perform the asanas which
                                    ensures that the mind is actively focused on and communicating with the body. This oneness allows the
                                    body to respond more effectively to the Asanas, encouraging to keep pushing one's limits higher and deeper.
                                    Yogatree has shown me the path towards a healthy and stressfree life. Trust the vibes and the energy
                                    in this studio... the practice here aligns the mind .. the body and everything just flows making Yoga

                                    experiences with Yogatree and the benefits she derived from yoga – better stamina, reduced anxiety and
                                    calmer mind being some of them. I have thoroughly enjoyed my yoga journey – starting with reducing the
                                    struggle I had with my shoulder/back pain, increased stamina and calmness (to combat the crazy Bangalore
                                    traffic) and reduce stress levels overall. While the student's efforts are important, we think the teachers
                                    at Yogatree made a huge impact on our practice - classes are well paced, enough variety through the week,
                                    personal attention and constantly improving themselves by asking for feedback. There is a saying : ‘When
                                    the student is ready, the teacher appears’. We truly believe this in our yoga learning and thank Yogatree

                    Drawing from our teachers’ collective experience of all major schools of yoga such as Mysore Ashtanga, BKS Iyengar, Sivananda
                    and the Bihar School of Yoga, we have designed a weekly schedule that is a delightful combination of the uniqueness
                    of these schools and styles, with focus on flexibility, strength and endurance. Our distinctive schedule enourages
                    people to continue with daily practice and motivates them to make yoga a part of their daily life.

                    <h4>Power Yoga</h4>
                    <p>
                        As the name suggests, power yoga challenges your stamina, strength and flexibility. It is an intense work out through steady
                        yet controlled movements from one asana to another, synchronized with the breath. The teacher will help you
                        work with your body, expand your physical limits and create the highest levels of energy, vitality and freedom.
                        If you are looking for a challenging workout to tone your body, lose those extra kilos and feel confident
                        about yourself, this is the class to be in. Don’t forget to bring your hand towel as power yoga will make
                        you work out a good sweat!

                    <h4>Hatha Yoga</h4>
                    <p>
                        In this class, the teacher leads the practitioner through a set of asanas designed to align the body, breath and mind. The
                        asanas are chosen to help open up the channels of the body with primary focus on the spine. Hatha Yoga creates
                        balance in the body and restores health and vitality. With this practice, one can develop a balance between
                        strength and flexibility, a balance between effort and surrender in every espect of life. The Hatha Yoga
                        class is designed to bring the practitioner’s attention to breath, which is the bridge between the body and
                        the mind. It helps to still the fluctuations of the mind and teaches one to be present in the moment. Excellent
                        for maintaining an active body and quiet mind, Hatha Yoga can help you manage stress successfully and improve
                        your immunity tremendously.

                    <h4>Therapy Yoga</h4>
                    <p>
                        Therapy Yoga is a comprehensive system of restorative yoga poses combined with breath work and guided meditation, specifically
                        designed to enhance the body’s own capacity to heal. Although yoga as a practice is therapeautic, in a yoga
                        therapy session the intention completely focuses towards the specific healing need of the practitioner. In
                        Yogatree, we have been succesfully helping the members to manage or cure lower back pain, neck and shoulder
                        pain, knee pain and insomnia. Here we believe ” yoga teaches us to cure what need not be endured and endure
                        what cannot be cured”.

                    <h4>Restorative Iyengar Yoga</h4>
                    <p>
                        This class focuses on deep relaxation through pranayama and stress-relieving asanas. The teacher encourages the use of different
                        props like a belt, bolster and a wooden brick to get into the postures and remain there effortlessly. The
                        slow pace of this practice accompanied by deep breathing, stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system from
                        the very beginning of the session. At the end, the practitioner experinces a prolonged calmness of the mind
                        with expanded awareness of the self. This is one of the most popular classes in our studio, because of its
                        track record in alleviating stress successfully.

                    <h4>Yin Yoga</h4>
                    <p>
                        A passive practice, Yin Yoga involves variations of seated and supine poses typically held for longer duration. This style
                        of yoga practice generally targets the connective tissues such as ligaments, bones, even the joints of mainly
                        the hips, pelvis and lower spine. Yin yoga is a perfect complement to the dynamic and active styles of yoga
                        practices such as vinyasa or power yoga. It is also quite challenging in its own way as you are expected
                        to hold the postures for longer duration. This brings in a meditative approach to the practice aimed at cultivating
                        awareness of inner silence, and bringing to light a universal, interconnecting quality.

                    <h4>Vinyasa Flow Yoga</h4>
                    <p>
                        The term Vinyasa refers to gradual progression, it also refers to the alignment of breath and movement that makes up the
                        steps and leads to the next. In this class, the practitioner experiences a dynamic flow of asanas which can
                        be intense, vigorous, stimulating as well as focused and fully absorbing. Traditionally, the Surya Namaskara
                        remains a integral part of the flow. These intense sessions help the body to detoxify and reenergize while
                        completely relaxing the mind. Our practitioners love the experience of getting into the “Flow”.
